   <p>Some brief notes on the history of the game</p>

   <div class="row">
     <div class="history-col">
       <h3>Britain And Football</h3>
       <p>Records show that, in 1314, the Lord Mayor of London banned football in the city due to it causing ‘chaos’. If you were caught playing the game in London, you could be imprisoned. This was elaborated on during the 100 years England and France were at war, when Kings Edward II, Richard II, Hentry IV and Henry V made the game illegal throughout the UK due to it ‘taking away focus from practising military disciplines’, which were deemed more useful.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="history-col">
      <h3>Why Is A Football Game 90 Mins?</h3>
      <p>The standard length of game in football is 90 minutes. 
        This duration was established for the first time in 1866 when London and Sheffield played against one another. 
        For one reason or another, from here onward, 90 minutes was set as the standard duration for football games. 
        Although, modern underage games do not use the 90-minute format.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="history-col">
      <h3>Founding Of Fifa</h3>
      <p>The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was established in Paris in 1904.
        <br> Its founding members included Belgium, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Stanley Rous, who went on to become FIFA President, wrote the laws of football and put rational to them in 1886. They were re-drafted in 1997.

        By the 1950s, after the Second World War, there were more than 73 FIFA members.</p>
